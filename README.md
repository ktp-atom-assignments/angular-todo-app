## Angular To Do App

### What is this?
This is a To Do List app hosted at https://kaplan-angular-todo.herokuapp.com. Most features work fine, but users are complaining that after they mark an item as complete, the item returns to an incomplete state when they refresh the page.

### Requirements
Determine what the problem is, and if possible why this is happening. Clearly document your findings, including:
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Steps you took to investigate the problem (e.g., tools you used, screenshots)
- Relevant error messages you found
- Explanation of why the bug is occurring
- Where the bug is in the code and how to fix it
